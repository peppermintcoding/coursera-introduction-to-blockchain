# Blockchain Design Principles

Privacy and security are the underlying principles of blockchain. But it can do more than that. It can protect civil and property rights. There are seven design principles to blockchain.

## Network Integrity

Trust does not come from an outside source, a third party like a bank or insitution. So the four values, *honesty*, *consideration*, *accountability* and *transparancy*, are coded into the blockchain directly. This integrity is distributed among all of the nodes and acting without it comes with great cost or loss of reputation.
The problem with integrity online is because money and assets aren't easy to share online. Money can't exist at two places at once. Online money can be spend twice without any of the others knowing about it, the *double spending problem*. Therefore we need a bank to validate transactions.
On the bitcoin blockchain every transaction is timestamped and can't be spend again after that. The network relies on *proof of work* for trust. By solving a puzzle with computing power it validates a block on the blockchain. Solving the problem is hard, but validating that the problem is solving is easy.
In Ehtherium this proof will move from proof of work to *proof of stake*. Social networks can also be used for proof. When someone is trustworthy they get a vote.
On the blockchain, the truth of the present relies on the proof of the past. For a bitcoin to be valid it must reference its history on the blockchain. Therefore the blockchain must be present in its entirety and can't be cut up easily.
